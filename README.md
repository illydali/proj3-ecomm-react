# Strategy
In recents years vinyl records have dramatically increased in popularity - even outselling digital music. Many new releases are available on vinyl and even older releases are now being reissued on vinyl. With the exception of large, international sites such as Discogs, or non-specialist sites such as eBay there is little in the way of sites that focus on the secondhand and collectible record trade.

#### Target Audience
- Music lovers
- Collectors
- Musicians/DJs
- Vintage decorators

### Site Owner Goals
As a site owner, I aim to cater to lovers and collectors of vinyl records so that they have the option to view, select and purchase the records from the comfort of home. 

### User Goals

As a user of the website, I want to be able to easily find the latest LP releases so that I can save time from going down in person.

As a user of the website, I want somewhere where I am able to browse LPs by labels or genres without leaving the comfort of my home. 

As a vinyl record collector, I want to have a website that is easy to search, shop and pay for my purchases. 

As a vintage decor fan, I want a seamless site where I can browse through and view each pic of the album sleeve without having to deep dive endlessly at a physical store.

The design strategy for the website is to exude a vintage analog feel. This also helps in allowing the photos of the album sleeves to stand out thus catering to vintage collectors and music lovers at the same time.
